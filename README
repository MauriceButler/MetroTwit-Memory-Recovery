See a need, fill a need...

After seeing many, many people complaining on twitter about the memory hungry ways of the popular Twitter client MetroTwit (http://www.metrotwit.com/), I figured a work around to the problem might be in order until the MetroTwit guys can address the issue.

Enter MetroTwit-Memory-Recovery!!!!

This is a notification tray app that monitors the running MetroTwit process at configurable intervals and check the private memory usage. If this is above a configurable threshold, the application is closed and restarted.

Its far from a perfect solution but from what the MetroTwit team is saying about address the memory issues, this should be a temporary work around.
